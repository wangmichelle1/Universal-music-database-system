For this project, we created our database and procedures using SQL within the MySQL workbench. For the database application that allows the user to interact with our database, we used Python, using the PyCharm platform. We allow the user to interact with our database through the run window on the bottom of the screen in PyCharm, where we will provide good, easy to interpret feedback to the user based on their input. Our application allows the user to first make an account if they are a first time user. We also ask them to input the streaming service(s) they use. Then, we allow them with plenty of ways to interact with our database, whether that be through searching, adding, deleting, updating, and/or checking. Through searching, we allow users to search for artist, song, album as well as artist review, song review, and album review. Then of course, we also allow the user to add and delete songs and artist, song, and album reviews, but only be able to delete reviews that they made themselves. Users can also update the different reviews they made if they ever change their thoughts on a song, artist, or album. Lastly, we allow users to check statistics regarding themselves based on the number of song, artist, and album searches as well as song, artist, and album review searches. We also provide the user with information on the users per streaming service. The user can do as many actions on our application as they want before exiting out.
